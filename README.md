Welcome to Rescue Groups!
  Animal shelters in the United States face an ongoing issue of overcrowding, with an estimated 6.3 million domestic animals entering shelters every year, according to the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA). Unfortunately, about 10% of adopted pets are returned to shelters annually because they turn out to be a poor match with the new owners. This cycle not only stresses the animals but also discourages potential pet owners from adopting, as they struggle to find the perfect match. The current process lacks a structured, reliable system that helps individuals find their ideal pet efficiently, leading to frustration and potentially more animals being returned to shelters.
	Our project aims to address this issue by using the RescueGroups API to develop a centralized platform that simplifies the pet adoption process. By providing potential adopters with key information, such as location, size, age, and breed of available pets, and integrating interactive features like filters, we will streamline the matchmaking process between adopters and pets. Utilizing React and JavaScript for the front-end, we aim to reduce the time and effort required for adopters to find a compatible pet, which will help lower the 10% return rate, reduce the number of pets without forever homes, and result in more successful adoptions.
	This solution will benefit both future pet owners and animal shelters by creating a more structured and reliable matchmaking process, ensuring pets find their forever homes while reducing shelter overflow. By increasing the success rate of pet adoptions, this platform will contribute to reducing the number of animals in shelters, making a positive impact on the shelter system and the community at large.

Our project website pages are designed for a desktop target browser and best displays on landscape desktop or laptop screens. This type of browser would best allow for all of our features and designs to show up as intended to each viewer/user. 

Developer Manual - [Developer Manual](docs/developer-manual.md)


-------------------------------------
## Bottom Half of README should include:
- The audience of this document is future developers who will take over your system.
- They know technical terms and have general knowledge about web applications, but do not have knowledge about your system design.
- You need to provide a technical document so that future developers can start setting up the application on their local machines, and keep working on the system development after you leave the team.
- Your Developer Manual covers:
  - How to install your application and all dependencies
  - How to run your application on a server
  - How to run any tests you have written for your software
  - The API for your server application - all GET, POST, PATCH, etc endpoints, and what they each do
  - A clear set of expectations around known bugs and a road-map for future development.
- Documentation needs to be written in Markdown (MD) files, nicely formatted
- Documentation should be included in each teamâ€™s final code submission.
- Documentation should be saved in your main project directory under "docs"
