## Description

Welcome to Rescue Groups!

Animal shelters in the United States face an ongoing issue of overcrowding, with an estimated 6.3 million domestic animals entering shelters every year, according to the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA). Unfortunately, about 10% of adopted pets are returned to shelters annually because they turn out to be a poor match with the new owners. This cycle not only stresses the animals but also discourages potential pet owners from adopting, as they struggle to find the perfect match.

Our project aims to address this issue by using the RescueGroups API to develop a centralized platform that simplifies the pet adoption process. By providing potential adopters with key information, such as location, size, age, and breed of available pets, and integrating interactive features like filters, we will streamline the matchmaking process between adopters and pets. Utilizing React and JavaScript for the front-end, we aim to reduce the time and effort required for adopters to find a compatible pet, which will help lower the 10% return rate, reduce the number of pets without forever homes, and result in more successful adoptions.

This solution will benefit both future pet owners and animal shelters by creating a more structured and reliable matchmaking process, ensuring pets find their forever homes while reducing shelter overflow.
